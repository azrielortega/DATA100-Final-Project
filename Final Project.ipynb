    "## Introduction\n",
    "Socioeconomic status refers to the position of a certain individual or group of people which is based on the combination of different economic factors such as income and expenditures (American Psychological Association, 2015a). In order to assess the socioeconomic status of person or group, survey questionnaires are usually done to get specific information such as educational attainment, income, occupation, family size, and relationships (American Psychological Association, 2015b). In the Philippines collecting this kind of data is done through the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing socioeconomic status in the Philippines, however is more difficult as there is no standard SEC models. But with the data collected from the FIES, It can provide the necessary information in order for the government to create policies regarding the socioeconomic status in the country (Philippines Statistics Authority, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "As such, this project aims to do the following:\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis on the different variables of dataset\n",
    "- Identify the different factors affecting the household income of Filipino families\n",
    "- Visualize data and get insights based on the analysis performed."
